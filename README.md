# Basic-E-commerce-Website
This is a basic t-shirt selling website with all the CRUD fucntionalities added for the admin. 
The  Code is divided in Backened and Frontend. Frontend hosted on **Netfliy** and backend on **Heroku**. 
Their is a admin login id: admi@admin.com, password: 12345 for accessing admin features.
### Both frontend and backend are on the same repo, and I know this is not the right way to use the git.
